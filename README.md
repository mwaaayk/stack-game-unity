# Stack Game

A little Unity project I made inspired by **Stack** by Ketchapp.  
You tap (or click) to drop moving blocks and try to stack them as perfectly as you can.  
The more precise you are, the higher your tower grows â€” miss a little and your block gets chopped.  
Eventuallyâ€¦ well, gravity wins.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play
- Blocks slide back and forth.
- Tap/Click to place them.
- Perfect drops = perfect size.
- Missed drops = smaller blocks.
- Keep going until thereâ€™s nothing left to stack.

## ðŸ›  Made With
- Unity
- C# scripts
- A lot of patience for getting those perfect drops.
